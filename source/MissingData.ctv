      Missing data are very frequently found in datasets. Base R provides a few options to handle them using computations that involve only observed data (<code>na.rm = TRUE</code> in functions <code>mean</code>, <code>var</code>, ... or <code>use = complete.obs|na.or.complete|pairwise.complete.obs</code> in functions <code>cov</code>, <code>cor</code>, ...). The base package stats also contains the generic function <code>na.action</code> that extracts information of the <code>NA</code> action used to create an object.
    </p>
    <p>These basic options are complemented by many packages on CRAN, which we structure into main topics:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#exploration">Exploration of missing data</a></li>
      <li><a href="#likelihood">Likelihood based approaches</a></li>
      <li><a href="#single">Single imputation</a></li>
      <li><a href="#multiple">Multiple imputation</a></li>

    <p>In addition to the present task view, this <a href="https://rmisstastic.netlify.com/">reference website on missing data</a> might also be helpful.</p>
<p>If you think that we missed some important packages in this list, please contact the maintainer.</p>

    <p><a name="exploration"><strong>Exploration of missing data</strong></a></p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Manipulation of missing data</i> is implemented in the packages <pkg>sjmisc</pkg> and <pkg>sjlabelled</pkg>. <pkg>memisc</pkg> also provides defineable missing values, along with infrastruture for the management of survey data and variable labels.</li>
      <li><i>Missing data patterns</i> can be identified and explored using the packages <pkg>mi</pkg>, <pkg>dlookr</pkg>, <pkg>wrangle</pkg>, <pkg>DescTools</pkg>, and <pkg>naniar</pkg>.</li>
      <li><i>Graphics that describe distributions and patterns of missing data</i> are implemented in <pkg>VIM</pkg> (which has a Graphical User Interface, VIMGUI, currently archived on CRAN) and <pkg>naniar</pkg> (which abides by <a href="https://tidyverse.org">tidyverse</a> principles).</li>
      <li><i>Tests of the MAR assumption (versus the MCAR assumption)</i> are implemented in the function <code>LittleMCAR</code> from <pkg>BaylorEdPsych</pkg> (Little's test) and in <pkg>MissMech</pkg> (a non parametric test). <pkg>RBtest</pkg> proposes a regression based approach to test the missing data mechanism.</li>
      <li><i>Evaluation</i> with simulations can be performed using the function <code>ampute</code> of <pkg>mice</pkg>. The package <pkg>missCompare</pkg> provides a complete framework for evaluating different imputation strategies.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><a name="likelihood"><strong>Likelihood based approaches</strong></a></p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Methods based on the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm</i> are implemented in <pkg>norm</pkg> (using the function <code>em.norm</code> for multivariate Gaussian data), in <pkg>cat</pkg> (function <code>em.cat</code> for multivariate categorical data), in <pkg>mix</pkg> (function <code>em.mix</code> for multivariate mixed categorical and continuous data). These packages also implement <i>Bayesian approaches</i> (with Imputation and Posterior steps) for the same models (functions <code>da.</code>XXX for <code>norm</code>, <code>cat</code> and <code>mix</code>) and can be used to obtain imputed complete datasets or multiple imputations (functions <code>imp.</code>XXX for <code>norm</code>, <code>cat</code> and <code>mix</code>), once the model parameters have been estimated. <pkg>imputeR</pkg> is a Multivariate Expectation-Maximization (EM) based imputation framework that offers several different algorithms, including Lasso, tree-based models or PCA. In addition, <pkg>TestDataImputation</pkg> implements imputation based on EM estimation (and other simpler imputation methods) that are well suited for dichotomous and polytomous tests with item responses.</li>
      <li><i>Full Information Maximum Likelihood</i> (also known as "direct maximum likelihood" or "raw maximum likelihood") is available in <pkg>lavaan</pkg>, <pkg>OpenMx</pkg> and <pkg>rsem</pkg>, for handling missing data in structural equation modeling.</li>
      <li><i>Bayesian approaches</i> for handling missing values in model based clustering with variable selection is available in <pkg>VarSelLCM</pkg>. The package also provides imputation using the posterior mean.</li>
      <li><i>Missing values in mixed-effect models and generalized linear models</i> are supported in the packages <pkg>mdmb</pkg>, <pkg>icdGLM</pkg> and <pkg>JointAI</pkg>, the last one being based on a Bayesian approach. <pkg>brlrmr</pkg> also handles MNAR values in response variable for logistic regression using an EM approach. <pkg>ui</pkg> implements uncertainty intervals for linear and probit regressions when the outcome is missing not at random.</li>

    </ul>

    <p><a name="single"><strong>Single imputation</strong></a></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The simplest method for missing data imputation is <i>imputation by mean</i> (or median, mode, ...). This approach is available in many packages among which <pkg>ForImp</pkg>, <pkg>Hmisc</pkg>, and <pkg>dlookr</pkg> that contain various proposals for imputing with the same value all missing instances of a variable.</li>

      <li><i>hot-deck</i> imputation is implemented in <pkg>hot.deck</pkg>, <pkg>FHDI</pkg> and <pkg>VIM</pkg> (function <code>hotdeck</code>). <pkg>StatMatch</pkg> uses hot-deck imputation to impute surveys from an external dataset. <pkg>impimp</pkg> also uses the notion of "donor" to impute a set of possible values, termed "imprecise imputation".</li>
      <li><i>Other regression based imputations</i> are implemented in <pkg>VIM</pkg> (linear regression based imputation in the function <code>regressionImp</code>). In addition, <pkg>simputation</pkg> is a general package for imputation by any prediction method that can be combined with various regression methods, and works well with the tidyverse. <pkg>WaverR</pkg> imputes data using a weighted average of several regressions. <pkg>iai</pkg> tunes optimal imputation based on knn, tree or SVM.</li>
      <li><i>Based on random forest</i> in <pkg>missForest</pkg>.</li>
      <li><i>Based on copula</i> in <pkg>CoImp</pkg> and in <pkg>sbgcop</pkg> (semi-parametric Bayesian copula imputation). The latter supports multiple imputation.</li>
      <li><i>PCA/Singular Value Decomposition/matrix completion</i> is implemented in the package <pkg>missMDA</pkg> for numerical, categorical and mixed data. Heterogeneous missingness in a high-dimensional PCA is also addressed in <pkg>primePCA</pkg>. <pkg>softImpute</pkg> contains several methods for iterative matrix completion, as well as <pkg>filling</pkg>, <pkg>rsparse</pkg> and <pkg>denoiseR</pkg> for numerical variables, <pkg>mimi</pkg> that uses low rank assumptions to impute mixed datasets, and <pkg>ECLRMC</pkg> performs ensemble correlation based low rank matrix completion that accounts for correlation among samples. The package <bioc>pcaMethods</bioc> offers some Bayesian implementation of PCA with missing data. <i>NIPALS</i> (based on SVD computation) is implemented in the packages <bioc>mixOmics</bioc> (for PCA and PLS), <pkg>ade4</pkg>, <pkg>nipals</pkg> and <pkg>plsRglm</pkg> (for generalized model PLS). As a generalization, <pkg>tensorBF</pkg> implements imputation in 3-way tensor data. <pkg>ddsPLS</pkg> implements a multi-block imputation method based on PLS in a supervised framework. <pkg>ROptSpace</pkg> proposes a matrix completion method under low-rank assumption and collective matrix factorization for imputation using Bayesian matrix completion for groups of variables (binary, quantitative, Poisson). Imputation for groups is also available in <pkg>missMDA</pkg> in the function <code>imputeMFA</code>.</li>
      <li><i>Imputation of clustered data</i> using k-means is implemented in <pkg>ClustImpute</pkg>.</li>
      <li><i>Imputation for non-parametric regression by wavelet shrinkage</i> is implemented in <pkg>CVThresh</pkg> using solely maximization of the h-likelihood.</li>
