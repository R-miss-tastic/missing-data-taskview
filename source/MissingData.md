Missing data are very frequently found in datasets. Base R provides a
few options to handle them using computations that involve only observed
data ( `na.rm = TRUE` in functions `mean`, `var`, \... or
`use = complete.obs|na.or.complete|pairwise.complete.obs` in functions
`cov`, `cor`, \...). The base package stats also contains the generic
function `na.action` that extracts information of the `NA` action used
to create an object.

These basic options are complemented by many packages on CRAN, which we
structure into main topics:

-   [Exploration of missing data](#exploration)
-   [Likelihood based approaches](#likelihood)
-   [Single imputation](#single)
-   [Multiple imputation](#multiple)
-   [Weighting methods](#weights)
-   [Specific types of data](#data)
-   [Specific application fields](#applications)

In addition to the present task view, this [reference website on missing
data](https://rmisstastic.netlify.com/) might also be helpful.

If you think that we missed some important packages in this list, please
contact the maintainer.

[**Exploration of missing data**]{#exploration}

-   *Manipulation of missing data* is implemented in the packages
    `r pkg("sjmisc")` and `r pkg("sjlabelled")`.
    `r pkg("memisc")` also provides defineable missing values,
    along with infrastruture for the management of survey data and
    variable labels.
-   *Missing data patterns* can be identified and explored using the
    packages `r pkg("mi")`, `r pkg("wrangle")`,
    `r pkg("DescTools")`, `r pkg("dlookr")` and
    `r pkg("naniar", priority = "core")`.
-   *Graphics that describe distributions and patterns of missing data*
    are implemented in `r pkg("VIM", priority = "core")` (which
    has a Graphical User Interface, VIMGUI, currently archived on CRAN)
    and `r pkg("naniar")` (which abides by
    [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org) principles).
-   *Tests of the MAR assumption (versus the MCAR assumption):*
    `r pkg("RBtest")` proposes a regression based approach to
    test the missing data mechanism and `r pkg("samon")`
    performs sensitivity analysis in clinical trials to check the
    relevance of the MAR assumption.
-   *Evaluation* of the quality of imputation can be performed using the
    function `ampute` of `r pkg("mice", priority = "core")`
    through with simulations or with the `r pkg("Iscores")`
    with a KL-based scoring rule.

[**Likelihood based approaches**]{#likelihood}

-   *Methods based on the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm* are
    implemented in `r pkg("norm")` (using the function
    `em.norm` for multivariate Gaussian data),
    `r pkg("norm2")` (using the function `emNorm`), in
    `r pkg("cat")` (function `em.cat` for multivariate
    categorical data), in `r pkg("mix")` (function `em.mix`
    for multivariate mixed categorical and continuous data). These
    packages also implement *Bayesian approaches* (with Imputation and
    Posterior steps) for the same models (functions `da.` XXX for
    `norm`, `cat` and `mix`) and can be used to obtain imputed complete
    datasets or multiple imputations (functions `imp.` XXX for `norm`,
    `cat` and `mix`), once the model parameters have been estimated.
    `r pkg("imputeR")` is a Multivariate
    Expectation-Maximization (EM) based imputation framework that offers
    several different algorithms, including Lasso, tree-based models or
    PCA. In addition, `r pkg("TestDataImputation")` implements
    imputation based on EM estimation (and other simpler imputation
    methods) that are well suited for dichotomous and polytomous tests
    with item responses.
-   *Full Information Maximum Likelihood* (also known as "direct
    maximum likelihood" or "raw maximum likelihood") is available in
    `r pkg("lavaan")` (and in its extension
    `r pkg("semTools")`), `r pkg("OpenMx")` and
    `r pkg("rsem")`, for handling missing data in structural
    equation modeling.
-   *Bayesian approaches* for handling missing values in model based
    clustering with variable selection is available in
    `r pkg("VarSelLCM")`. The package also provides imputation
    using the posterior mean.
-   *Missing values in mixed-effect models and generalized linear
    models* are supported in the packages `r pkg("mdmb")`,
    `r pkg("icdGLM")` and `r pkg("JointAI")`, the
    last one being based on a Bayesian approach.
    `r pkg("brlrmr")` also handles MNAR values in response
    variable for logistic regression using an EM approach.
    `r pkg("ui")` implements uncertainty intervals for linear
    and probit regressions when the outcome is missing not at random.
-   *Missing data in item response models* is implemented in
    `r pkg("TAM")`, `r pkg("mirt")` and
    `r pkg("ltm")`.
-   *Robust* covariance estimation is implemented in the package
    `r pkg("GSE")`. Robust location and scatter estimation and
    robust multivariate analysis with missing data are implemented in
    `r pkg("rrcovNA")`.

[**Single imputation**]{#single}

-   The simplest method for missing data imputation is *imputation by
    mean* (or median, mode, \...). This approach is available in many
    packages among which `r pkg("ForImp")` and
    `r pkg("Hmisc")` that contain various proposals for
    imputing with the same value all missing instances of a variable.
-   *k-nearest neighbors* is a popular method for missing data
    imputation that is available in many packages including
    `r bioc("impute")`, `r pkg("VIM")`,
    `r pkg("GenForImp")` and
    `r pkg("yaImpute", priority = "core")` (with many different
    methods for kNN imputation, including a CCA based imputation).
    `r pkg("wNNSel")` implements a kNN based method for
    imputation in large dimensional datasets.
    `r pkg("isotree")` uses a similar approach that is based
    on similarities between samples to impute missing data with
    isolation forests.
-   *hot-deck* imputation is implemented in
    `r pkg("hot.deck", priority = "core")`,
    `r pkg("FHDI")` and `r pkg("VIM")` (function
    `hotdeck`). `r pkg("StatMatch")` uses hot-deck imputation
    to impute surveys from an external dataset.
    `r pkg("impimp")` also uses the notion of "donor" to
    impute a set of possible values, termed "imprecise imputation".
-   *Other regression based imputations* are implemented in
    `r pkg("VIM")` (linear regression based imputation in the
    function `regressionImp`). In addition,
    `r pkg("simputation")` is a general package for imputation
    by any prediction method that can be combined with various
    regression methods, and works well with the tidyverse.
    `r pkg("WaverR")` imputes data using a weighted average of
    several regressions. `r pkg("iai")` tunes optimal
    imputation based on knn, tree or SVM.
-   *Based on random forest* in `r pkg("missForest")` with a
    faster version in `r pkg("missRanger")`.
-   *Based on copula* in `r pkg("CoImp")`, in
    `r pkg("mdgc")` (mixed type data), and in
    `r pkg("sbgcop")` (semi-parametric Bayesian copula
    imputation). The latter supports multiple imputation.
-   *PCA/Singular Value Decomposition/matrix completion* is implemented
    in the package `r pkg("missMDA", priority = "core")` for
    numerical, categorical and mixed data. Heterogeneous missingness in
    a high-dimensional PCA is also addressed in
    `r pkg("primePCA")`.
    `r pkg("softImpute", priority = "core")` contains several
    methods for iterative matrix completion, as well as
    `r pkg("filling")`, `r pkg("rsparse")` and
    `r pkg("denoiseR")` for numerical variables,
    `r pkg("mimi")` that uses low rank assumptions to impute
    mixed datasets, and `r pkg("ECLRMC")` performs ensemble
    correlation based low rank matrix completion that accounts for
    correlation among samples. The package
    `r bioc("pcaMethods")` offers some Bayesian implementation
    of PCA with missing data. *NIPALS* (based on SVD computation) is
    implemented in the packages `r bioc("mixOmics")` (for PCA
    and PLS), `r pkg("ade4")`, `r pkg("nipals")` and
    `r pkg("plsRglm")` (for generalized model PLS). As a
    generalization, `r pkg("tensorBF")` implements imputation
    in 3-way tensor data. `r pkg("ROptSpace")` proposes a
    matrix completion method under low-rank assumption and collective
    matrix factorization for imputation using Bayesian matrix completion
    for groups of variables (binary, quantitative, Poisson). Similarly,
    `r pkg("cmfrec")` proposes different version of matrix
    imputation based on matrix factorization. Finally, imputation for
    groups is also available in `r pkg("missMDA")` in the
    function `imputeMFA`.
-   *Imputation for non-parametric regression by wavelet shrinkage* is
    implemented in `r pkg("CVThresh")` using solely
    maximization of the h-likelihood.
-   `r pkg("mi")` and `r pkg("VIM")` also provide
    diagnostic plots to *evaluate the quality of imputation.*
